## Introduction to Flexbox

The CSS for your html element starts with `display: flex;` and this makes the content in flex container spans the width of the screen.

`display: inline-flex;` will only spand the width of the content

All the html children of the container become flex items.

When working with flexbox, having a container with some height on it helps you visualize. This height would be provided by your content elements in a real project.
